## About

This webpage was created using HTML, CSS, and some vanilla JS. This was my final project for a college course I was taking while also enrolled with Lambda School's Full Stack Web Development cohort. While JavaScript was not taught in the college course and especially not required with the project I did find that it helped complete the webpage by simulating the form completion in the "Contact Us" section by sending the user an alert with the information submitted as well as clearing the form.

## Goals

This project is complete and there are no future goals for it.
